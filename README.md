# Front-End Developer Test | Napptilus Tech Labs 

This project consists in a web application that uses an internal API to show all the information about the stored Oompa Loompas.

## How to run it

1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the server: `npm start`

## FYI
1. The proyect needed to show the images of the Oompa Loompas that the API returned, but those were accessible. Instead an static image is shown for every Oompa Loompa.
2. The logo icon was impossible to download, so it was removed from the header
3. The search icon was also impossible to download, so a random one was used for this functionality
